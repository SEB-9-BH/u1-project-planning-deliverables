## Project planning deliverables

Planning is vital to build anything more than the most trivial of applications; therefore, this is where you will begin your journey with this project. You shouldn't write any code or set up a GitHub repo for your project until an instructor approves your planning materials.

### Details

You will submit the following details about your project for approval by your instructor:

- Your choice of game.
- Pseudocode for the overall gameplay. This pseudocode does not need to go into exhaustive detail but should demonstrate that you understand some of the unique challenges you will encounter while building your game. 
- Detailed README.md (Project Title, Description, How to Get Started, Credits).
- A Trello Board detailing the plan and progress of your project.
- A wireframe of your "main" game screen. Online tools you can use to create your wireframe include [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) and [Wireframe.CC](https://wireframe.cc/).
- Any additional project planning requirements specific to the game you have chosen as defined in the in the **Additional Planning Requirements** column of the table in the **[Recommended games](./recommended-games/README.md)** document or as discussed with your instructor.
- **Your game must be approved by the instructors before you begin your project.**
